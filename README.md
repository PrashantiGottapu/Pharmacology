Chapter 1: Adrenergic Drugs
  Adrenergic drugs are a broad class of medications that bind to adrenergic receptors throughout the body. These receptors include: alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, beta-3. Adrenergic drugs will bind directly to one or more of these receptors to induce various physiologic effects. Adrenergic drugs must be classified based on the specific receptors they bind. This activity examines the pharmacology, various therapeutic effects, and adverse events that class members can exert, which covers a wide variety of clinical manifestations.

Objectives:

Identify the various actions of adrenergic medications based on the receptor to which they bind.
Describe the various adverse effects of adrenergic drugs based on the binding site.
Review the contraindications to various adrenergic drugs based on their preferred binding sites.
Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team leading to improved patient care when using adrenergic agents.

Chapter 2: Tannins, Pharmacognosy
  The name ‘tannin’ is derived from the French ‘tanin’ (tanning substance) and is used for a range of natural polyphenols. Tannins are complex organic, non-nitrogenous plant products, which generally have astringent properties. These compounds comprise a large group of compounds that are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The term ‘tannin’ was first used by Seguin in 1796 to denote substances which have the ability to combine with animal hides to convert them into leather which is known as tanning of the hide. According to this, tannins are substances which are detected by a tanning test due to its absorption on standard hide powder. The test is known as Goldbeater’s skin test.

Chapter 3: Carbohydrates, pharmacognosy
    Carbohydrates (CHO) are organic compounds (also called hydrated carbon) or polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy ketones.
containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Carbohydrates are widely distributed in plants and animals; they have important structural and metabolic roles.
In plants, glucose is synthesized from carbon dioxide and water by photosynthesis. 

Chapter 4: General Anesthetics, Pharmacology
    General anesthesia is a state characterized by unconsciousness, analgesia, amnesia, skeletal muscle relaxation, and loss of reflexes. Drugs used as general anesthetics are CNS depressants with actions that can be induced and terminated more rapidly than those of conventional sedative-hypnotics.

Chapter 5: Anti-Anginal  drugs, Pharmacology
      Antianginal drugs are used primarily to restore the balance between the oxygen supply and demand of the heart. These drugs dilate the coronary vessels to increase the flow of oxygen to the ischemic regions. Other than that, they also decrease the workload of the heart so the organ would have less demand for oxygen.
